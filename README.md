# Project Overview
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict insurance claim severity using the Allstate Claims Severity dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to develop and compare multiple regression models to accurately forecast claim costs based on anonymized features.
Main objectives:

Implement a complete data preprocessing pipeline
Compare baseline and advanced machine learning models
Perform systematic hyperparameter tuning
Ensure reproducibility and code documentation
Analyze model performance and business implications
